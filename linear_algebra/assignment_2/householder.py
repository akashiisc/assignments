## HOUSEHOLDER constructs a HOUSEHOLDER matrix.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    A Householder matrix is also called an elementary reflector.
#
#  Formula:
#
#     A = I - ( 2 * X * X' ) / ( X' * X )
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 5, X = ( 1, 1, 1, 0, -1 )
#
#   1/2 -1/2 -1/2  0  1/2
#  -1/2  1/2 -1/2  0  1/2
#  -1/2 -1/2  1/2  0  1/2
#    0    0    0   1   0
#   1/2  1/2  1/2  0  1/2
#
#  Properties:
#
#    A is symmetric: A' = A.
#
#    Because A is symmetric, it is normal.
#
#    Because A is normal, it is diagonalizable.
#
#    A is orthogonal: A' * A = A * A' = I.
#
#    inverse ( A ) = A.
#
#    det ( A ) = -1.
#
#    A is unimodular.
#
#    If Y and Z are nonzero vectors of equal length, and
#      X = ( Y - Z ) / NORM(Y-Z),
#    then
#      A * Y = Z.
#
#    A represents a reflection through the plane which
#    is perpendicular to the vector X.  In particular, A*X = -X.
#
#    LAMBDA(1) = -1;
#    LAMBDA(2:N) = +1.
#
#    If X is the vector used to define H, then X is the eigenvector
#    associated with the eigenvalue -1.
